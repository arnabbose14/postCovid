# BOOLEANS
#one of the most important data types in Computer Programming is Boolean
# we switch on and off lights a result can be represented in 0 which is False capital "F"
# and 1 which is True with a capital "T"

#COMPARISON
# To understand boolean we need understand a few signs when COMPARING:
# == means equals to
# >= means greater than equals to
# <= means less than equals to
# != means not equals to

print(True == 0) # This statement contradicts as True explained previously means 0
# So the == here is comparing True to 0 which is false.

#the results of this kind of comparisons can only be true or false
print(1>5)  #False or 0
print(1<5)  #True or 1
print("asd" == 3) #False or 0
