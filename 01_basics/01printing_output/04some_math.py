#dont be afraid here easy maths

print((3+4)>(3/6))  #the result is a boolean True as we are comparing

#Modulo
# We have a very special term called modulo "%" not percentage or percent
print(5%2) #result = 1
print(7%2) #result = 1
print(8%2) #result = 0
print(343%34) #result = 3

# observe when we modulo any even number by 2 the result is always zero

#Exponents (To the power of)
print(4**5) #This is basically 4x4x4x4x4 or 4 raised to the power 5

#Floor Divisions
print(5/2) #result = 2.5
print(5//2) #result is the nearest whole number which is 2
# this type of divisions are important for us specially in shaders
# imagine a situation where a 1m long wall has to be covered with 120mm bricks
# with 10mm cement inbetween such situations need whole number results as we need
# to calculate number of bricks needed in integer format.
