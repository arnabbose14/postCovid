# variables are placeholders where we can store values.
a = 5 #Here a is a variable
# Variables can be Integer, Float or String

# Since "a" is a place holder for the value 5 we can print a
print(a) #result is 5
# to check the data type of a type
print(type(a)) #result <class 'int'> meaning of type int or integer

# a can be reassigned to any other value
a = 10
print(a) # now the placeholder stores 10 insted of the previous value 5
# Lets try a few more times

a = 2.5
print(type(a)) #Result: <class 'float'> 

a = "You are good at this."
print(type(a)) #Result: <class 'str'>

#So the variables value mutates to not only different values but also different types
#This is called mutablity.

# Some variable declarations 
w = 6778
# variables with string values are put between quotes
myName = "aviik" #This kind of variable naming is called camel casing
my_name = "aviik" #This is also a good variable naming

my_float = 64.685594 #variable of type float
